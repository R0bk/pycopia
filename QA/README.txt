Pycopia QA package.

Pycopia packages to support professional QA roles.  A basic QA automation
framework. Provides base classes for test cases, test suites, test
runners, reporting, lab models, terminal emulators, remote control, and
other miscellaneous functions.

There is a remote control agent that uses a subset of Pycopia to allow
controlling Linux and Windows hosts for distributed testing.

There is also an ANSI terminal emulator that can be used as a stream filter
for console applications (simplifying automation).
