===========

Read MIB/SMI files directly in Python. Iterate over definitions, get the OID.

This package is an SMI reader for Python. It uses the libsmi_ library from
Frank Strauss, Technical University of Braunschweig. You should already
have this installed before beginning this installation. Most Linux
distributions have it available. Make sure to also in stall any "devel"
packages.

Take a look at the test.py script to see an example of how to use this.
