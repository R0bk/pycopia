Pycopia-mibs
============

Pycopia's collection of pre-compiled MIBs. 

This package contains MIBs converted to a Python source form that are more
readily imported and used by the SNMP package. The is the package space where
these generated modules are found.

Only the basic MIBs for SNMP v2 are in this package. There is a tarball_
available that contains a much larger collection of pre-compiled MIBs.
Untarring this into /var/tmp will make it automatically available for import
from the Pycopia.mibs package namespace.
