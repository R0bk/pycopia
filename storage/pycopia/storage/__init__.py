Pycopia Persistent Storage
==========================

Module for Pycopia persistent storage. Based on the Durus persistence package.

This package is provides a wrapper around Durus to make it sumulate a
hierarchical structure. It provides persistent storage of Python data that
is fast and direct. It's here for your use if you need it, but nothing
else in Pycopia currently uses it.
