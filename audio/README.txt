Pycopia-audio
=============

Pycopia audio package. 

Audio and telephony modules for Python.  Provides modules for controlling
the alsaplayer program, and interfacing to mgetty/vgetty. Also includes a
basic telephone answering machine, with email message delivery (you need a
voice modem).

It also requires some extensive system configuration for mgetty/vgetty and
voice spooler, logfile location, etc. 

NOTE: I can't test this code right now, and the alsaplayer interface
      is changing. But it all used to work...
