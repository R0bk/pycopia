INSTALL
=======

NOTE: The install operation requires that the sudo command be configured for you.

There are many dependencies. You should see the primary installation
documentation under doc/source/install.


Install script
--------------

The top-level setup script helps with dealing with all sub-packages at
once. It also provides an installer for a developer mode.

Invoke it like a standard setup.py script. However, Any names after the
operation name are taken as sub-package names that are operated on. If no
names are given then all packages are operated on.

Commands:
 list         -- List available subpackages. These are the names you may optionally supply.
 publish      -- Put source distribution on pypi.
 build        -- Run setuptools build phase on named sub-packages (or all of them).
 install      -- Run setuptools install phase.
 eggs         -- Build distributable egg package.
 rpms         -- Build RPMs on platforms that support building RPMs.
 msis         -- Build Microsoft .msi on Windows.
 wininst      -- Build .exe installer on Windows.
 develop      -- Developer mode, as defined by setuptools.
 develophome  -- Developer mode, installing .pth and script files in user directory.
 clean        -- Run setuptools clean phase.
 squash       -- Squash (flatten) all named sub-packages into single tree
                 in $PYCOPIA_SQUASH, or user site-directory if no $PYCOPIA_SQUASH defined.
                 This also removes the setuptools runtime dependency.

Most regular setuptools commands also work. They are passed through by
default.
