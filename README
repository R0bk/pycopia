Overview
========

The Pycopia package is a collection of Python (and some C) modules for use in
Python  applications. There is support for network management, "Web" frontends,
XML processing, process control, and more.


Some noteworthy sub-packages and modules:

SNMP          -- An implementation of SNMP v1 and v2c (Manager only now.. but Agent
                 class just needs to be filled in). 

SMI           -- A library, based on wrapping libsmi, for parsing and accessing MIB
                 files. 

Devices       -- Defines SNMP Manager objects for specific devices. You can create a
	         class that represent as device, and define which MIBs it supports.

POM           -- Python Object Model for XML. This is patterned after XML DOM, but is
                 more pythonic. It also incorporates some XPath funcionality. 

XHTML         -- Utilities and classes for creating XHTML documents. This is based on
                 the Pythonic Object Model (POM) module, also found here. 

WWW.framework -- A web framework supporting virtual domains.

process       -- Spawn supprocesses. Interact with them using the Expect
		 object. Get process stats. 

CLI           -- Toolkit for making interactive command tools fast and easy.

debugger      -- Enhanced Python debugger.

QA            -- Test harness and framework for running tests, managing tests,
                 and recording results.

storage       -- A database for keeping persistent configuration, the equipment
                 object model, test cases and test results.


This library is mostly governed by the Lesser GNU Public License (LGPL). If a
module comes from another source then it may have another, more liberal,
license. Parts here may be Other Peoples Code under the BSD or MIT license.


INSTALL
=======

The top-level setup script helps with dealing with all sub-packages at
once. It also provides an installer for a nicer developer mode. 

Invoke it like a standard setup.py script. However, Any names after the
operation name are taken as sub-package names that are operated on. If no
names are given then all packages are operated on.

Commands:
 list         -- List available subpackages. These are the names you may optionally supply.
 publish      -- Put source distribution on pypi.
 build        -- Run setuptools build phase on named sub-packages (or all of them).
 install      -- Run setuptools install phase.
 eggs         -- Build distributable egg package.
 rpms         -- Build RPMs on platforms that support building RPMs.
 msis         -- Build Microsoft .msi on Windows.
 wininst      -- Build .exe installer on Windows.
 develop      -- Developer mode, as defined by setuptools.
 develophome  -- Developer mode, installing .pth and script files in user directory.
 clean        -- Run setuptools clean phase.
 squash       -- Squash (flatten) all named sub-packages into single tree
                 in $PYCOPIA_SQUASH, or user site-directory if no $PYCOPIA_SQUASH defined.
                 This also removes the setuptools runtime dependency.

Most regular setuptools commands also work. They are passed through by
default.

NOTE: The install operation requires that the sudo command be configured for you.


Prerequisites
-------------

Installation requires haveing some additional build-time dependencies installed
first.

Many of these are 

Required for building
+++++++++++++++++++++

python-dev    -- Of course, Python and any development packages.
setuptools    -- For its namespace package support and general building.
pyrex         -- Some extension modules need to to generate C files.
libsmi        -- For SMI parsing.

Optional
++++++++

Packages required at run time. Many of these are automatically installed
from pypi at installation time.
